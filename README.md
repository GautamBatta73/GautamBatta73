Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gautam Batta, a Computer Scientist with a passion for helping people, programming, and problem-solving and a knack for math and science. ðŸ¤–

I created this profile to showcase my work and share knowledge and ideas with the tech community. ðŸ’»

Here are some of my favourite projects that I've worked on:

* SidGautamAI: An AI Chat Assistant that uses DeepSeek V3, DeepSeek R1, and Meta's Llama4. Hosted on [Here](https://sidgautam.ca/ai-chat/).
* SidGautamJS: A JavaScript Library that adds some interesting and helpful features, and it also adds some not-so-helpful things.

Feel free to reach out to me for:

* Collaboration opportunities
* Questions about my projects
